      <description>The ChaosGrenade is now being hosted on Neocities.Org. If that name raises some slight nostalgia, it&amp;rsquo;s no coincidence, as it&amp;rsquo;s a nod to the old days of Geocities &amp;ndash; back before social media when everyone had a website, and we &amp;ldquo;networked&amp;rdquo; through web rings. I figured it was time to quit piggy-backing off my brother&amp;rsquo;s webhost, and Neocities met all my needs.
What does this mean for the site, exactly? Only that I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to remain as a &amp;ldquo;static&amp;rdquo; web blog.</description>

      <description>The old blog site is dead. May this one endure.
Last week I was made aware that adware had infiltrated my site. Certain pages and methods of access (like Google) resulted in redirects to spam and phishing sites.
I have no ill feelings towards Wordpress, except as someone who infrequently blogs it was becoming a chore to keep up to date. Several times in the past I&amp;rsquo;ve had issues with plug-ins, themes, and even the software updates themselves.</description>
