      <description>&lt;p&gt;What follows is a set of house rules I originally came up with to run&lt;a href=&#34;http://thestrangerpg.com/&#34;&gt;The Strange&lt;/a&gt; by Monte Cook Games using &lt;strong&gt;Fate Accelerated&lt;/strong&gt; by Evil Hat Studios. At the time, I wasn’t too sure how I felt about the Cypher System. Since then, I’ve ran quite a few games using both The Strange and the &lt;strong&gt;Cypher System Rulebook.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s grown on me, and it’s one of my favorite new systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Summer comes to an end, and I find myself back in the college swing. Which means I’m taking a small break at the moment from REWIRED  after hammering on it the last few months. I’ve been trying to catch back up and see what’s been going on in the RPG communities, and checking out the current big titles these days. Dungeon World and 13th Age pop up a lot in my feeds, and they look real whiz but I can’t justify investing into more fantasy/dungeon crawl games, especially d20 variants.</description>
