      <description>Gavriel Quiroga was really cool to send me a review copy of his game Neurocity,a dystopian nightmare RPG that has recently released following a successful Kickstarter. Itâ€™s clocking in at 126 pages for the PDF, although that includes covers, a couple pages of backer names, and a few blanks that I believe are just there for layout purposes.
NEUROCITY was pitched to me as PARANOIA meets Clive Barker, and I feel that is accurate and an understatement.</description>
