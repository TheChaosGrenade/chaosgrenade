      <description>Today’s post is looking at five different supplements available from RPGNow, each of them no more than a few bucks. I’ve been enjoying the hell out of **White Star. **And one of the solid strengths of it is the amazing community and third-party support that is running with it.
Psionics **Author: **Matthew Skail
**Cost: **$1.99
**Page Count: **11 (including cover and license)
_Psionics _is what it says on the tin: a psionicist class for White Star.</description>

      <description>I have a curse where every time I say “I don’t need another OSR game!” I open up my wallet and acquire another one.
**White Star **is written by James M. Spahn and released by Barrel Rider Games. The gist of it is they took the rules from Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry Whitebox and hacked it into their own super slick science fiction game. Now, I’m already a rabid fan of Kevin Crawford’s _Stars Without Number, _and I was hesitant to toss $10 at a lighter, simpler game.</description>
