      <description>I am shocked that I’m not seeing any buzz over this awesome upcoming title. Let’s remedy that.
Against the Darkmaster is a game that started out as a clone/house-ruled version of Middle Earth Role-Playing and Rolemaster but has evolved into its own game. The authors list various inspirations from books by Tolkien, Brooks and Goodkind to movies from 70’s and 80’s like Dragonslayer and Krull. They even have an extensive Spotify playlist of heavy metal music and really you should just go look at their God-damned awesome looking website.</description>
