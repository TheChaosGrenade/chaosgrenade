      <description>What is MAIN SEQUENCE? MAIN SEQUENCE is a fast, “Rules-Necessary” science fiction RPG written by Matt Bryant.
It uses the WyRM System, originally found in titles like Warrior, Rogue &amp;amp; Mage and Resolute, Adventurer &amp;amp; Genius.
MAIN SEQUENCE characters have three Attributes (Soldier, Agent and Tech). They choose a handful of skills and Tags, some equipment, and then they’re off on their planetary adventures! Folks who are wanting a traditional space RPG with a little meat on the bone, but don’t want to be bogged down with bloated catalogs of tech or complex space battles will be at home in MAIN SEQUENCE.</description>
