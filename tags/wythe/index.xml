      <description>The entity paralyzing Samantha pays no attention to Julia, continuing to attempt to suffocate her with a swarm of shadowy bugs that bleed out from its outstretched hands. Julia hurriedly gestures her spell and screams &amp;ldquo;By my will, I demand you be banished from this place!&amp;rdquo; In a flash, ghostly arms wisp out and grab the horror, dragging it into the mirror as it howls in anguish. Julia rushes to Samantha&amp;rsquo;s side as she finally wakes up, sitting straight up and screaming.</description>

      <description>Samantha couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep the nights following her encounter at the Wythe Estate. Any time she closed her eyes, that wretched man-bug with the hollowed eyes was there&amp;hellip; its severed and inhuman teeth. When she was awake, especially on the nights following, something else was there.
It hid in plain sight &amp;ndash; even when she meditated and gazed across the curtain into the Echo, it was only there the edges of the periphery.</description>

      <description>This narrative is a continuing example of gameplay for Sigil &amp;amp; Shadow, my role-playing game of Urban Fantasy &amp;amp; Occult Horror. We left Samantha Cane being pursued by some kind of gnarly half-humanoid, half-insect monstrosity chasing her out of an abandoned estate.
 You can catch up on part one here You can also check out Samantha Cane&amp;rsquo;s Character Sheet Learn more about Sigil &amp;amp; Shadow here   Our Story Continues Samantha runs out into dark night, sliding in the mud and frantically trying to find an escape from the Wythe estate grounds.</description>

      <description>Samantha Cane exits her ride, tips the driver, and proceeds to walk down the wet street towards the Wythe estate. Myrtle and Benjamin Wythe, as the local stories tell, were a couple found mutilated and murdered in their upper-end mansion back in the 1980s. They were pillars of the community â€” he was a business owner and once city council member; she was active in the PTA and their church. Both were found in their living room, tongues cut out and their hearts removed.</description>

      <description>This is Part 2 of a series showing game play examples for Sigil &amp;amp; Shadow. You can read Part 1 here.
Today we&amp;rsquo;re having a look at a sample Shadowed character. These are the monstrous characters of our game, having embraced a darker side of them in exchange for paranormal power. Instead of defining how every vampire, werewolf, zombie or other thing that goes bump in the night works, we&amp;rsquo;ve established four broad courts of shadow &amp;ndash; the Ravenous, the Devoted, the Afflicted and the Hosts.</description>
