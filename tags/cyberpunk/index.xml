      <description>Gavriel Quiroga was really cool to send me a review copy of his game Neurocity,a dystopian nightmare RPG that has recently released following a successful Kickstarter. It’s clocking in at 126 pages for the PDF, although that includes covers, a couple pages of backer names, and a few blanks that I believe are just there for layout purposes.
NEUROCITY was pitched to me as PARANOIA meets Clive Barker, and I feel that is accurate and an understatement.</description>

      <description>Cut To The Chase Neon City Overdrive is a new cyberpunk rpg put out by Nathan Russell/Peril Planet (creator of Freeform Unlimited), and is available in PDF for $8. From the sales pitch from their DTRPG Listing:
NEON CITY OVERDRIVE is a fast-playing RPG of cyberpunk action. With a focus on story and action, character creation is fast and the rules are intuitive. Create any kind of cyberpunk character you want and throw them into the action within minutes.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Anarchy</title>

      <description>Shadowrun: Anarchy is a title that I often call a “flawed gem” — a great game marred by poor execution. Rushed edits, a somewhat schizophrenic design (is it a core rulebook? Is it a supplement?), stretching itself thin trying to please both traditional SR veterans and newcomer storygamers. But despite all of that, underneath the rubble you can find the chassis of a slick, streamlined and adaptable dicepool system.
While I’m excited to see where the Sixth World Edition is heading, I find myself slinking back into my copy of Anarchy (goblinized warts and all).</description>

      <description>Warning: Harsh NSFW Language Ahead
I recently began work on an obscene sandbox that primarily uses **The Rad Hack **but also borrows from other titles like Cyber Hacked, Augmented Reality, Other Dust and any thematically appropriate stuff I find in the OSR community.
I’ve actually begun running it as a Play-by-Post via a private Facebook Group. This format actually works well because it means I can troll Google Images for inspirational artwork to every scene and character, and we also keep an “Out of Character” chat open in messenger for “table talk” moments.</description>

      <title>Ramblings on Shadowrun: Anarchy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it happened.&lt;br&gt;
Catalyst Game Labs released &lt;em&gt;**&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/194759/Shadowrun-Anarchy?hot60=0&amp;amp;src=hnum&#34;&gt;Shadowrun: Anarchy,&lt;/a&gt; **&lt;/em&gt; an “alternate rules set” that aims at letting players run the shadows of the Sixth World in a more story-driven rules set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a solid, full review of &lt;em&gt;Anarchy&lt;/em&gt; I highly recommend the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Casting Shadows review.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;  Otherwise, I’m just going to sit here and gush fanboy for a moment…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Oh man, the Street Samurai.
Years before I would know who Molly Millions was, I was a dorky 9 year old kid who laughed when my dad referred to my older brother’s weekend pastime as “Dungeons &amp;amp; Dumbass.” But then one Saturday morning, my brother had left out a book he borrowed from a friend. A book with a hot elf chick on the cover in cut off jeans, a book filled with gritty sci-fi urban landscapes, tribal shamans, and fantasy characters with electrodes plugged into their skull.</description>

      <description>So, after playing **Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown **a bunch this week with Tim Kirk (of Silverlion Studios), I was inspired to whip-up **SHADOW OPS: Covert Ops in the Sixth World. **It’s a fan tribute to the Shadowrun franchise, inspired by the gameplay of the recent PC games using a mash-up of COVERT OPS and BareBones Fantasy from DwD Studios. I’m pretty happy with what I threw together between studying for finals, and the initial reactions from the BBF Community on G+ have been stellar.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shadow Ops: Covert Ops in the Sixth World&lt;/strong&gt; is a fan tribute to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Shadowrun&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; franchise, using a mash-up of Covert Ops and BareBones Fantasy by &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;DwD Studios.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Inspired by the streamlined mechanics and tactical play of the PC games in particular, it only seemed fitting to mix one of the biggest and best settings in the RPG industry with the fast-playing d00Lite system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
