      <description>The old blog site is dead. May this one endure.
Last week I was made aware that adware had infiltrated my site. Certain pages and methods of access (like Google) resulted in redirects to spam and phishing sites.
I have no ill feelings towards Wordpress, except as someone who infrequently blogs it was becoming a chore to keep up to date. Several times in the past I&amp;rsquo;ve had issues with plug-ins, themes, and even the software updates themselves.</description>
